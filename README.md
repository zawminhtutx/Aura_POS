> A visually stunning, minimalist, and modern web-based Point of Sale (POS) system designed for retail environments. Built on Cloudflare's edge network, it offers a lightning-fast and intuitive interface for processing sales.

Aura POS is a web-based Point of Sale (POS) system designed for modern retail. It features a dual-panel UI for an efficient workflow: one panel for managing the current transaction (cart) and another for browsing and selecting products. The system includes integrated barcode scanning capabilities using the device's camera, real-time cart updates, and a streamlined checkout process. The design prioritizes clarity, ease of use, and aesthetic elegance, making it a joy for cashiers to use on desktops or tablets.

## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd aura-pos
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This project uses Bun for package management.
    ```sh
    bun install
    ```

## üíª Development

To run the application in a local development environment, use the following command. This will start the Vite development server for the frontend and a local Wrangler server for the backend API.

```sh
bun dev
```

The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if 3000 is in use), and it will automatically proxy API requests to the Cloudflare Worker running locally.

## üöÄ Deployment

This project is configured for seamless deployment to Cloudflare's global network.

1.  **Login to Wrangler:**
    If you haven't already, authenticate Wrangler with your Cloudflare account.
    ```sh
    bunx wrangler login
    ```

2.  **Deploy the application:**
    Run the deploy script, which will build the frontend application and deploy both the static assets and the worker.
    ```sh
    bun deploy
    ```

Alternatively, you can deploy your own version of this project with a single click.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The codebase is organized into three main directories:

-   `src/`: Contains the frontend React application, including pages, components, stores (Zustand), and hooks.
-   `worker/`: Contains the Hono backend application that runs on Cloudflare Workers, including API routes and entity definitions for Durable Objects.
-   `shared/`: Contains TypeScript types and mock data shared between the frontend and the backend to ensure type safety.
